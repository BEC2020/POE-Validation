# POE-Validation

Proof-of-Existence Validation

Goal

Users can upload files (images, docs) to a decentralized Blockchain application to be registered and validatated as an immutable record in the Blockchain network and the file is saved on IPFS(Decentralised Database). A Proof of Existence (POE) is created, showing that the doc was uploaded at a particular time/hour. The validation is done when the document is again uploaded to the system and the user will be able to view the file served from IPFS.

Description

This project provides a Web3 DApp - Decentralized Application connected to Ethereum Rinkeby nodes where users can upload files (images, documents) from their local computer where the files get stored on IPFS , thus creating "hashes" of this document with their time-stamps and IPFS Hash that are stored in the Blockchain network . The website registers all uploaded doc hashes and allows users to upload the same document again to verify its authenticity and time/date when it was originally uploaded. User can also view the file from IPFS at any point of time.
