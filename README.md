# POE-Validation

Proof-of-Existence Validation

Goal

Users can upload files (images, docs) to a decentralized Blockchain application to be registered and validatated as an immutable record in the Blockchain network. A Proof of Existence (POE) is created, showing that the doc was uploaded at a particular time/hour. The validation is done when the document is again uploaded to the system.

Description

This project provides a Web3 DApp - Decentralized Application connected to Ethereum Rinkbye nodes where users can upload files (images, documents) from their local computer creating "hashes" of this document with their time-stamps that are stored in the Blockchain network. The website registers all uploaded doc hashes and allows users to upload the same document again to verify its authenticity and time/date when it was originally uploaded.
